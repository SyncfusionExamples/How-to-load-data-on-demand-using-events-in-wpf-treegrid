# How to load data on demand using events in WPF TreeGrid

This example illustrates how to load data on demand using events in [WPF TreeGrid](https://www.syncfusion.com/wpf-controls/treegrid) (SfTreeGrid).

`SfTreeGrid` supports to load the data in on-demand through [SfTreeGrid.RequestTreeItems](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.TreeGrid.SfTreeGrid.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_TreeGrid_SfTreeGrid_RequestTreeItems) event. `RequestTreeItems` event is triggered at the time of loading and when user expand any node at runtime. SfTreeGrid gets the root and leaf nodes through this event handler.

`TreeGridRequestTreeItemsEventArgs.ParentItem` denotes the data object looking for its child nodes. If it is null, it denotes SfTreeGrid requesting root nodes.

In the below example SfTreeGrid is populated through `SfTreeGrid.RequestTreeItems` instead of setting [SfTreeGrid.ItemsSource](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.TreeGrid.SfTreeGrid.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_TreeGrid_SfTreeGrid_ItemsSource).

``` csharp
ViewModel viewModel = new ViewModel();
treeGrid.RequestTreeItems += TreeGrid_RequestTreeItems;
      
private void TreeGrid_RequestTreeItems(object sender, TreeGridRequestTreeItemsEventArgs args)
{

    if (args.ParentItem == null)
    {
        args.ChildItems = viewModel.Employees.Where(x => x.ReportsTo == -1);
    }

    else
    {
        EmployeeInfo employee = args.ParentItem as EmployeeInfo;

        if (employee != null)
        {
            args.ChildItems = viewModel.GetEmployees().Where(x => x.ReportsTo == employee.ID);
        }
    }
}
```

``` csharp
public class EmployeeInfo
{
    int _id;
    string _firstName;
    string _lastName;
    private string _title;
    double? _salary;
    int _reportsTo;

    public string FirstName
    {
        get { return _firstName; }
        set { _firstName = value; }
    }

    public string LastName
    {
        get { return _lastName; }
        set { _lastName = value; }
    }

    public int ID
    {
        get { return _id; }
        set { _id = value; }
    }

    public string Title
    {
        get { return _title; }
        set { _title = value; }
    }
 
    public double? Salary
    {
        get { return _salary; }
        set { _salary = value; }
    }

    public int ReportsTo
    {
        get { return _reportsTo; }
        set { _reportsTo = value; }
    }
}
